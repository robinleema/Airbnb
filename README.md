# Airbnb Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings, focusing on data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing listing prices and to develop interactive visualizations were created using Power BI to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains Airbnb listings, including various features such as price, location, property type, and amenities. The data is sourced from                     [(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYlU0Wq4Ay-z_CTU3qviTwZd_eDp0vIB/edit)].

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Techniques used include:

 - Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
 - Imputing missing values
 - Encoding categorical variables

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables. Key insights include:

 - Distribution of listing prices
 - Correlation between price and other features
 - Trends over time and location

## Visualizations
Interactive visualizations were created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These visualizations help in understanding the data and communicating findings effectively.

## Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide an intuitive way to explore and visualize the Airbnb data.

 - Overview of key metrics
 - Interactive filters for dynamic analysis
 - Detailed breakdowns of listing prices, locations, and property types

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing Airbnb listing prices. The predictive models developed can assist hosts in setting competitive prices and optimizing their listings.

## Future Work

Future improvements to this project may include:

 - Incorporating additional features such as reviews and host information
 - Deploying the model as a web application
